# the_seed_prototype


####The absolute ugliest thing to have ever been created. 

As the backend team, we felt we had no reason to create a prototype which would not be marked, nor used by the frontend team. 
The process of creating and documenting our work (via school website) was the only thing that mattered, so this abomination was born. 

All of the comments we received talked about the "intuitive placement and good flow" and "disgusting aesthetics".
